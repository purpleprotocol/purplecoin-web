You can use any coin, token, or asset built on top to pay transaction fees or exchange between them. It is the only blockchain which can be used purely by owning only a stablecoin or other FIAT equivalent. \n\nXPU is built with compatibility between any kind of financial system in mind and is designed to support the volumes and needs of commercial entities.",
