Purplecoin represents a new breed of blockchain protocols called **stateless blockchains**.

Bitcoin was the first stateful blockchain while Purplecoin is the first stateless blockchain.  

The easiest way to explain the differences between the two is like this: a stateful blockchain stores all transactions of everyone while a stateless blockchain does not. **Users of a stateless blockchain store only their own transaction**. This means syncing an XPU full-node **takes minutes** while syncing a Bitcoin node takes days.
