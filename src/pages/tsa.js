<h4>
10. RISKS
</h4>
<p>
10.1. You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing, holding, and using Tokens.
</p>
<p>
10.2. BY PURCHASING TOKENS, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ASSUME THESE FOLLOWING RISKS:
</p>
<p>
10.2.1. Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error. A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a digital wallet or vault service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your Tokens. Additionally, your failure to follow precisely the procedures for buying and receiving Tokens, including, for instance, if you provide the wrong address for receiving Tokens, may result in the loss of your Tokens.
</p>
<p>
10.2.2. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with Purplecoin Token and/or the Purplecoin Platform in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of any Group Entity may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of Purplecoin Token and/or the Purplecoin Platform, which could negatively affect Purplecoin Token and/or the Purplecoin Platform.
</p>
<p>
10.2.3. Risk of Uninsured Losses. Purplecoin Token is uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. In the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.
</p>
<p>
10.2.4. Risks Associated with Markets for Tokens. Tokens are intended to be used solely to get access to the Services of the Platform, and Company will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Tokens.
</p>
<p>
10.2.5. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions. The regulatory status of Purplecoin Token and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions, but numerous regulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the implementation of regulatory regimes which govern cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency markets. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including Purplecoin Token and Purplecoin Platform. Regulatory actions could negatively impact Purplecoin Token in various ways. The Seller or any Group Entity may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction,
</p>
<p>
10.2.6. Risks Arising from Taxation. The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.
</p>
<p>
10.2.7. Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography. Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Tokens, which could result in the theft or loss of Tokens.
</p>
<p>
10.2.8. Risk of Insufficient Interest in Tokens, Services of the Platform or Distributed Applications.
</p>
<p>
10.2.9. Risk of Dissolution of the Company. It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in Tokens’ utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Company may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.
</p>
<p>
10.2.10. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights. Because Tokens confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Company, all decisions involving the Company will be made by Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue to sell more Tokens for use, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the utility of Tokens that you hold.
</p>
<p>
10.2.11. All other unanticipated risks.
